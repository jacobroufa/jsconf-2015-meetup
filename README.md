# Maintaining a Local Dev Meetup
What do you do when you only have a few regular attendees? Is your own schedule so crammed you can't sustainably present every topic every month? Do you still want a local user group? Some hard won experience from a local web developer meetup co-organizer. Or, how we kept the user group going and helped foster continued growth in attendance and participation.
